# polygon_algorithms
By Chan Wee Kiat

This repository contains polygon algorithms of the following:

1. Point in Polygon
2. Line in Polygon

## Point in Polygon 

**Requirements**
[Matplotlib](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) for C++ (recommended)

**Files to be saved in the same folder:**
* ptinpoly.cpp (main script)
* geom.h (header file for helper functions)
* geom.cpp (cpp file for helper functions)
* matplotlibcpp.h (for plotting)

**How to compile:**
Run in command line (tested in linux)
`g++ ptinpoly.cpp geom.cpp -o ptinpoly -I/usr/include/python3.8 -lpython3.8`  (if using matplotlib)
or 
`g++ ptinpoly.cpp geom.cpp -o ptinpoly`

**How to run additional test cases:** (Suggested)
1. Using MATLAB, use [drawpolygon()](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/drawpolygon.html) function to draw any desired polygon 
2. Retrieve coordinates of the vertices from MATLAB workspace.
3. Copy and Paste into ptinpoly.cpp (need to add commas after each coordinate)
4. Re-compile

**How it works**
The point-in-polygon code utilises a Ray-Casting Algorithm to check if a given point is inside a simple convex/concave polygon. [Computational Geometry in C 2nd edition by Joseph Oâ€™Rourke, page 239.](https://github.com/sarcilav/analisis-numerico/blob/master/doc/Computational%20Geometry%20In%20C%202nd%20ed.%20-%20J.%20O%27Rourke%20(1997)%20WW.pdf)

**Step 1:** Iterate through every vertex of polygon. 

**Step 2:** Check the following:

1. The position is between the current vertex and the next, and 
2. Position is collinear to both vertices. 
If the position is between 2 vertices and collinear, it is on the edge of the polygon, thus return 'outside'. 

**Step 3:** Check if the y coordinates of both current and next vertex are on the same side of the horizontal ray (from the position) or lying on the ray. 

This will generate 4 different conditions:
1. Both on opposite sides (inside)
2. 1 above, 1 on the ray (inside)
3. 1 below, 1 on the ray (outside)
4. Both on the ray (outside)
    
**Step 4:** If we get conditions 1 and 2 from step 3, check if the position is on the left or right side of the vertices. 

As the horizontal ray is in the direction of the positive x-axis, the position must be on the left of the 2 vertices in order to intersect. [Cross product](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/direction-point-line-segment/) is used to determine where the point is with respect to the two vertices. 

**Step 5:** For every intersection in step 4, the inside_flag is switched. A better way to understand is: Odd number of intersection = inside, Even number of intersection = outside.

## Line in Polygon 

**Requirements**
[Matplotlib](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) for C++ (recommended)

**Files to be saved in the same folder:**
* lineinpoly.cpp (main script)
* geom.h (header file for helper functions)
* geom.cpp (cpp file for helper functions)
* matplotlibcpp.h (for plotting)

**How to compile:**
Run in command line (tested in linux)
`g++ lineinpoly.cpp geom.cpp -o lineinpoly -I/usr/include/python3.8 -lpython3.8` (if using matplotlib)
or 
`g++ lineinpoly.cpp geom.cpp -o lineinpoly`

**How to run additional test cases:** (Suggested)
1. Using MATLAB, use [drawpolygon()](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/drawpolygon.html) function to draw any desired polygon 
2. Retrieve coordinates of the vertices from MATLAB workspace.
3. Copy and Paste into lineinpoly.cpp (need to add commas after each coordinate)
4. Re-compile

**How it works**
The line-in-polygon utilises a naive algorithm to check if the line (formed by two points) is not fully contained within a concave polygon. The algorithm iteratively checks for intersection between the line segment and every edge of the polygon. 

Step 1: Check if two given points are inside the polygon (using the point-in-polygon algorithm above). 
Step 2: Construct line segment from two given points.
Step 3: Iterate through every line segment and check for intersection. 
Step 4: If intersection exists, line is not fully contained within the concave polygon.
